/// A type-tagged Cliniko identifier — patient, appointment, or note.
///
/// Cliniko's wire shape for these resources is mixed: `Patient.id` is
/// documented as `string($int64)` and decoded as `String` (#127);
/// `Appointment.id` is also documented as `string($int64)` and decoded
/// as `String` (#129); `TreatmentNoteCreated.id` is still numeric
/// (`Int`) per the Cliniko `treatment_notes` POST response shape.
/// The audit ledger and `SessionStore` need an opaque-but-typed handle
/// that:
///
/// 1. **Refuses free-form strings** at every migrated callsite.
///    `AuditRecord.init(patientID:)` accepts only `OpaqueClinikoID`, not
///    `String` — so a contributor cannot accidentally widen the audit
///    schema to carry a patient name without changing the type. The
///    type *itself* is total over `String` (`init(rawValue:)` is
///    public for `Codable` round-trip), but every migrated boundary
///    speaks the typed form, which is the load-bearing win.
/// 2. Encodes/decodes as a **bare** JSON string so the on-disk
///    `audit.jsonl` schema stays unchanged from the `String`-typed
///    predecessor (issue #59 acceptance: audit-row schema unchanged on
///    disk). `RawRepresentable`'s synthesised Codable would emit a
///    wrapping `{"rawValue":"..."}` object — the custom `init(from:)`
///    / `encode(to:)` below flatten to a single-value container.
///    Pinned at the byte level by
///    `AuditStoreTests.line_pins_opaque_id_byte_shape`.
/// 3. Round-trips through the `Int` ↔ `String` boundary in one place.
///    Production code uses `init(_ int: Int)` at numeric Cliniko-response
///    boundaries (`TreatmentNoteCreated.id`) and `init(_ string: String)`
///    at string-shaped boundaries (`Patient.id` per #127 and
///    `Appointment.id` per #129); `init(rawValue: String)` is reserved
///    for Codable round-trip from `audit.jsonl` and for tests that want
///    deterministic string literals.
///
/// **Issue #59.** Replaces the three bare-`String` ID fields on
/// `AuditRecord` and the two on `ClinicalSession`. The wire-shape ID on
/// `TreatmentNoteCreated` (and the `Int` field on
/// `TreatmentNotePayload.appointmentID` / `.patientID` going OUT to
/// Cliniko) remain `Int` — that's the request-side wire shape Cliniko
/// expects for `POST /treatment_notes`. `Patient.id` (#127) and
/// `Appointment.id` (#129) flipped to `String` to match Cliniko's
/// documented `string($int64)` response shape on the read side.
///
/// **`RawRepresentable` rationale.** Required by the issue spec for
/// symmetry with the predecessor `String`-typed fields and so the
/// `rawValue` accessor is callable at the few legitimate string
/// boundaries (Codable, debug formatting). Do NOT drop the conformance
/// without first removing the custom `Codable` methods below — the
/// synthesised `RawRepresentable` Codable would re-emit the wrapping-
/// object shape and silently break `audit.jsonl` back-compat.
///
/// **PHI posture.** An `OpaqueClinikoID` is the same opaque resource
/// ID the Cliniko API itself logs in its CDN/load-balancer access
/// logs — it is not a name, DOB, or contact field. But it is
/// patient-correlatable: a `patient_id` in a leaked log is enough to
/// re-identify the patient given access to the Cliniko tenant.
/// Therefore: never use `OSLog`'s `privacy: .public` on an
/// `OpaqueClinikoID`, never interpolate one into a
/// `fatalError`/`assertionFailure` message. There is deliberately
/// **no** `CustomStringConvertible` conformance — `\(id)` falls back
/// to Swift's reflection-based form (`OpaqueClinikoID(rawValue:
/// "1001")`) which is obviously-PHI-shaped, so an accidental log
/// site reads as a leak rather than as an innocuous integer.
