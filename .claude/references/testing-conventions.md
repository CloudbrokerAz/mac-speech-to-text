This reference consolidates the testing framework decisions made across
EPIC #19 (F1–F5).

## Layered strategy

| Layer | Where it runs | What it contains |
|---|---|---|
| `pre-commit` (L0) | Every commit, local | SwiftLint + gitleaks + whitespace/yaml/json/markdownlint. <5s. |
| `pre-push` (L1) | Remote Mac via SSH | Full `swift test` + UI suite. Hardware-dependent. |
| `GitHub Actions` (L2) | PR + `main` | `swift test --parallel --enable-code-coverage` skipping hardware-dependent classes; llvm-cov → lcov → Codecov; pre-commit scoped to PR diff. |
| Nightly (L3) | Scheduled, remote Mac | `RUN_MLX_GOLDEN=1` LLM goldens + full UI suite. |

`.github/workflows/ci.yml` is the source of truth.

---

## Which framework to reach for

| Kind of test | Framework |
|---|---|
| New pure-logic or async test | **Swift Testing** (`@Test` / `@Suite` / `#expect`) |
| SwiftUI view render / crash detection | **XCTest + ViewInspector** |
| XCUITest E2E | **XCTest** (no equivalent in Swift Testing) |
| Visual regression for ReviewScreen / SafetyDisclaimer | **`pointfreeco/swift-snapshot-testing`** (scoped — see "Snapshots" below) |

Existing XCTest files stay. New code voluntarily adopts Swift Testing.
`Tests/SpeechToTextTests/Utilities/SwiftTestingExemplarTests.swift` is the
canonical idiom reference.

---

## Tags

Every Swift Testing test carries at least one tag from
`Tests/SpeechToTextTests/Utilities/TestTags.swift`:

| Tag | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `.fast` | Pure-logic, sub-millisecond. Default for new code. |
| `.slow` | Noticeably slower (real I/O, large fixtures). Promote a `.fast` test only when it becomes relevant for nightly-only runs. |
| `.requiresHardware` | Needs real mic / Accessibility TCC / display server / user keychain. Skipped on CI runners. |

Apply with `@Test(.tags(.fast))` or propagate down from `@Suite(.tags(.fast))`.

XCTest classes cannot be tagged. CI still filters them by name (see next
section).

## Mocking patterns (already on main)

| Dependency | Test-only replacement | File |
|---|---|---|
| HTTP (`URLSession`) | `URLProtocolStub.install(_:)` returning a `URLSessionConfiguration` | `Tests/SpeechToTextTests/Utilities/URLProtocolStub.swift` |
| HTTP response fixtures | `HTTPStubFixture.load(_:)` / `loadJSON(_:,_:)` loading from `Tests/SpeechToTextTests/Fixtures/` | `Tests/SpeechToTextTests/Utilities/HTTPStubFixture.swift` |
| Keychain (`SecureStore`) | `InMemorySecureStore` — actor-isolated `[String: Data]`, never imports `Security` | `Tests/SpeechToTextTests/Utilities/InMemorySecureStore.swift` |
| LLM (`LLMProvider` — once #3 lands) | `MockLLMProvider` with canned prompt-hash → response lookup | pending #3 |

Real Keychain / real LLM inference are **never** exercised in CI. They
run locally or pre-push on a real Mac.

---

## Fixtures layout

```
Tests/SpeechToTextTests/Fixtures/
  cliniko/
    requests/<endpoint>.json         # expected outgoing payloads
    responses/<endpoint>.json        # canned responses for URLProtocolStub
  soap/
    valid/<case>.json                # valid SOAP JSON from the LLM
    invalid/<case>.json              # edge cases the schema guard must reject
  llm/
    prompts/<case>.txt
    expected/<case>.json             # goldens (only used when RUN_MLX_GOLDEN=1)
```

Fixtures are code. Changes ship in a PR that explains *why* the shape
changed. **Never auto-regenerate fixtures from production data** — they
must never contain PHI.

---

## Snapshot tests (narrow)

`pointfreeco/swift-snapshot-testing` v1.17+ is the chosen library once
#24 / F5 lands, and it's scoped deliberately to:

- `ReviewScreen` (SOAP editor + manipulations + excluded drawer — #13)
- `SafetyDisclaimerView` (#12)

Everything else gets ViewInspector crash tests, not image snapshots.
Rationale: macOS font rendering and Retina scaling make blanket snapshot
suites noisy; visual regression only matters on the doctor-facing
review surface.

Record mode (`isRecording = true`) changes require a human reviewer
because they rewrite goldens unconditionally.

---

## CI skip list (current)

CI runs the XCTest suite minus these classes (hardware-dependent). When
an XCTest class migrates to Swift Testing and picks up
`.requiresHardware`, remove it from the list:

- `AudioCaptureServiceTests` — `AVAudioEngine.start` (real mic)
- `PermissionServiceTests` — `AXIsProcessTrustedWithOptions` / TCC
- `TextInsertionServiceTests` — `CGEventPost` + display server
- `VoiceTriggerMonitoringServiceTests` — transitively needs real mic
- `WakeWordServiceTests` — reads real WAV fixtures
- `GeneralSectionPersistenceTests` — shared-UserDefaults race under `--parallel` (fix tracked in #32)

The long-term target is to migrate these to Swift Testing + `.requiresHardware`
so the CI filter becomes `--skip-tag requiresHardware` (closes #31).

---

## Writing a new test — minimum bar

1. **Services**: a unit test. Hand-rolled protocol mocks in the test file.
2. **SwiftUI views**: a ViewInspector render / crash-detection test —
   even a one-line `XCTAssertNotNil(MyView())` is valuable because it
   catches `@Observable` + actor-existential regressions.
3. **New HTTP client**: tests via `URLProtocolStub` + fixtures under
   `Fixtures/cliniko/`.
4. **New credential-store consumer**: tests using `InMemorySecureStore`.
5. **LLM-consuming code**: tests via `MockLLMProvider` (unit) + goldens
   gated behind `RUN_MLX_GOLDEN=1` (nightly).

Every GH issue's acceptance-criteria section must name the tests the PR
is expected to add.

## Local workflow

```bash
swift test --parallel                                     # fast, most common
swift test --filter MyNewClassTests                       # while iterating
swift test --parallel --enable-code-coverage              # match CI shape
SWIFT_TEST_EXTRA="--skip-tag requiresHardware" ./scripts/remote-test.sh
pre-commit run --files <files>                            # mirror CI hooks
```
